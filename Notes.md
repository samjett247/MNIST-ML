# Notes on CNNs for MNIST
This can keep a log of digital documents and other materials that were helpful for understanding CNNs in PyTorch.

- [MNIST Walkthrough implemented in numpy](https://www.kaggle.com/scaomath/simple-mnist-numpy-from-scratch)
    - This might be a little low-level, but is definitely helpful to understand the fundamentals of what the ML frameworks (Torch, tensorflow, etc.) are doing under the hood.
- [MNIST CNN tutorial in PyTorch](https://adventuresinmachinelearning.com/convolutional-neural-networks-tutorial-in-pytorch/)
    - A tutorial to build a classifier for MNIST data using PyTorch. Only issue is I think the code is based on a beta version of PyTorch and some of the PyTorch API may have changed in the meantime.
