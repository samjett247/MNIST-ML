# Notes on CNNs for MNIST
This can keep a log of digital documents and other materials that were helpful for understanding CNNs in PyTorch.
- [MNIST tutorial PyTorch](https://nextjournal.com/gkoehler/pytorch-mnist)
    - Maybe a little better documented example of a pytorch algorithm, with the steps included. Also this one trained to a better accuracy than next example (98%).
- [MNIST tutorial PyTorch](https://www.kaggle.com/sdelecourt/cnn-with-pytorch-for-mnist)
    - Neural Nets walkthrough with PyTorch hosted on a Kaggle kernel. Code provided with lots of samples in Markdown
- [Convolutional Neural Nets (CNNs) background](http://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/)
    - A background on CNNs, with high-level concepts detailed. Definitely helpful to establish a vocabulary for discussing CNNs
- [MNIST Walkthrough implemented in numpy](https://www.kaggle.com/scaomath/simple-mnist-numpy-from-scratch)
    - This might be a little low-level, but is definitely helpful to understand the fundamentals of what the ML frameworks (Torch, tensorflow, etc.) are doing under the hood.
- [MNIST CNN tutorial in PyTorch](https://adventuresinmachinelearning.com/convolutional-neural-networks-tutorial-in-pytorch/)
    - A tutorial to build a classifier for MNIST data using PyTorch. Only issue is I think the code is based on a beta version of PyTorch and some of the PyTorch API may have changed in the meantime.
